This is the practical project "Recipes" from The Odin Project curriculum where I demonstrate my basic HTML knowledge by using the Boilerplate and other elements like headers, paragraphs, images, links and lists.  
The project by itself it's not something special, nevertheless I hope you'll like it after checking my recipes!  
The project it's also deployed on the web so you don't have to clone the repo or do anything else in order to see the result.  
Thank you for checking it out.  
UPDATE!!!  
Now, after learning different methods to display elements, font families, box-sizing and many other things about CSS, I styled the site as well with CSS, you can check it out right now by clicking on this link: https://alexeiluchian.github.io/odin-recipes/
